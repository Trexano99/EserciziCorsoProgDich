 The type <shape> represents a shape that is either a point, a
   circle, or a rectangle. A point is represented by a constructor
   Point that carries a value of type point. A circle is represented
   by a constructor Circle that carries a pair of type point * float,
   which represents the center of the circle and its radius. A
   rectangle is represented by a constructor Rect that carries a pair
   of type point*point.

0. Encode those two types.

1.  Define the function

      area: shape -> float

      based on this representation. Do not worry about
      well-formedness. For the circle, use System.Math.PI *)

      w * h

1. Write a function

center: shape -> point

that returns the center point of the figure
